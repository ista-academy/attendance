# attendance

A collaborative directory of ista-academy session and class attendees. Use the table below to add your full name and a link to your professional profile (LinkedIn or GitHub).

## Format rules / notes

- Use `First Last` (full name) in the first column.
- Put one or both profile links in the second column as Markdown links, for example: `[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile)` or `[GitHub](https://github.com/your-username)`.
- If your name contains the pipe character `|`, escape or avoid it (pipes break Markdown tables).
